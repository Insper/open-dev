# Open Development 2025/2

Welcome to the Open Development page for 2025/2. On this site, you will find all the course lessons and syllabus. The learning objectives covered are:

1. The student is capable of understanding a software project and fixing a bug or implementing an improvement.
2. The student is capable of making modifications that meet the technical and non-technical requirements of a software project.
3. The student is capable of interacting with a (remote) development team.

This course is gamified and entirely done using a *git* repository. Each student creates a user following the instructions in Lesson 01 and submits a Pull Request to be included in the repository. Each completed activity is delivered via a PR in the course repository and serves as evidence for the learning objectives mentioned above.

The course revolves around four types of activities:

* **Tutorial**: (Guided) Preparatory activities in the classroom.
* **Code**: Code contributions to external projects.
* **Community**: Non-technical contributions that can benefit users and developers of a project, such as documentation and translations.
* **Impact**: Significant results achieved through the student's participation in open projects.

More information about all possible activities can be found on the [Assessment](assessment.md) page.
