<ah-external-content src="slides.html" />less02in

The activity for this class involves creating a presentation explaining how the communities around the following software projects are organized:

1. Visual Studio Code
2. NeoVIM
3. Django
4. Blender
5. Kdenlive
6. NewPipe

Each group of 3 students should choose one of the above projects and research the following points.

0. What is the purpose of the project?
1. Where is the source code located? Which technologies are used?
2. What is the license? Are there public guidelines or any kind of bureaucracy for contributions?
3. Is there developer documentation?
    - Does it seem easy to compile/run?
    - Does it seem easy to modify?
4. How is the project governed?
    - Who are the key figures (developers, evangelists, etc.) in the project? If the project is large, mention two different areas in this item.
    - Is there a public roadmap?
    - Are external contributions accepted? How can one contribute?
    - Who makes the decisions?
5. Where can project members be found? Where can one seek help?
6. Does the project raise funds?
    - Are there companies sponsoring developers?
    - How much has been raised? And spent? For what purposes?
    - Who decides how the funds are spent?

Each group must create a 10 minutes presentation for the next meeting that addresses these questions.
