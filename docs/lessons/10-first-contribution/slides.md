# Suggestion I - Pandas

Data processing library used in Data Science.

- Complex project, with many special use cases
- Tons of textual and graphical data visualization features
- Python is familiar to most

[Test tickets](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/labels/Needs%20Tests) are generally easy to get started with and useful for the community.

# Suggestion II - Matplotlib

Plotting graphs in Python

The [Good first issues](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) list has several open issues or PRs that have been stalled for months and can be taken over by others.

------

# Suggestion III - Pyscript

Python running in the browser via WebAssembly

[Issue List](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/issues) has several that seem accessible.
