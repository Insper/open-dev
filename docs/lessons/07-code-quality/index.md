# 07 - Code quality

In Lesson [04 - Professional Project](../04-professional-project) we created a repo and website for an old project developed during the course. Now we are going to improve its quality by fixing the issues each group found using a linter tool. 

!!! warning
    We won't work on our own projects this time! Select a project from [ongoing projects page](../../projects/2024/2/index.md) and comment on the issue you'd like to do or create a new issue that you'd like to work on. Every project must have at least one issue with external participation. 


## Deliverable

- create a Pull/Merge request addressing a code quality issue found in another team's project. 
- work with other team to get a Pull/Merge request accepted in your repository

**Learning objective**: modify a project you are not familiar with and improve its code quality
