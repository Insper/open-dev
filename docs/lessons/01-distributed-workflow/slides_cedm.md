# Justification for the Course

In previous courses, we worked on:

- Creating a new project.
- Projects that typically end after the course.
- Projects that are never used by anyone.

#

In the industry, we usually work on existing projects:

- Fixing issues.
- Making improvements.
- Projects used by multiple users.
