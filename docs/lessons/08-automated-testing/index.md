# 08 - Automated testing

<ah-external-content src="slides.html" />

We will now add (some) automated testing to one of the projects from [ongoing projects page](../../projects/2024/2/index.md). Again, our objective in this activity is to get used to build and modify different projects. 

!!! warning
    You'll need to select a different project from the last Lesson [07 - Code Quality](../07-code-quality/index.md)

## Deliverable

:material-emoticon-outline:{ .achicon }

- create two issues with suggestions for testing in the selected project 
- send a Pull/Merge request addressing one of the issues you created and get it accepted

**Learning objective**: modify a project you are not familiar with and improve its code quality

Add to the pull request description a link to the accepted contribution.
