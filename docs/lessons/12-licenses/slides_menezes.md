# Free Software Licenses

Created by the Free Software Foundation to guarantee four freedoms for users when using software:

1. Unrestricted Execution
2. Study and Modify the Software;
3. Redistribute Copies;
4. Redistribute Copies of Your Modifications

**Distributing the sources is a prerequisite for items 2 and 3!**

Also called *reciprocal*.

# Open Source Initiative

![width:200px](https://opensource.org/files/osi_keyhole_300X300_90ppi_0.png)

- Founded to spread a less anti-commercial and ideological discourse
- Also promotes the "pragmatic" benefits of using "open source" software
- *Free* causes confusion in English
- Free (*free as in beer*)
- Free (*free as in freedom*)
- Founded by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens

----

# Open Source Software Licenses

More closely associated with the [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org), these are considered less "ideological."

- Often called *permissive*;
- Typically do not guarantee freedom;
- May impose other minor requirements or restrictions.

Examples: MIT, BSD

- Allow the distribution of software with proprietary parts.
- Allow the sale and complete *rebranding* of the software without any contribution to the original author.
