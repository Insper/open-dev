# People and Companies from FLOSS

Free and Open Source Software history is full of personalities that have contributed to shape the world we live in. In this activity pairs of students select a company or person with a strong history in FOSS and detail their contributions in a 30 minutes presentation followed by a 10 minutes guided discussion.

All presentations will be open to the general public, recorded and must be presented in english. The discussions will not be recorded. After presenting students can create a PR with the skill *FLOSS research* and upload a PDF of their presentations to the `apresentacoes/2023/` folder.
