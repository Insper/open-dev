# 11 - People and Companies from FLOSS

Free and Open Source Software history is full of personalities that have contributed to shape the world we live in. In this activity a group of students (3 students) select a company or person with a strong history in FOSS and detail their contributions in a 20 minutes presentation followed by a 10 minutes guided discussion.

All presentations will be open to the general public. After presenting students can create a PR with the skill *FLOSS research* and upload a PDF of their presentations to the `docs/presentations/2025/` folder.
