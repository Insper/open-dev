# Syllabus

## Assessment

This course has a gamified assessment system. At any time, you can check your grade by running:

<ah-terminal>
$ ./dev-aberto.py compute-grade your-blackboard-login
</ah-terminal>

Biweekly reports will be sent with a summary of what has been delivered and which criteria have been met, as well as the student's current grade. There is no possibility of losing points. Although the report is for informational purposes only, if the student is not failing due to absences, they should receive the grade indicated in the biweekly reports.

!!! warning "Attention"
    The complete list of rules is available on the [Course Rules](assessment.md) page and is the official reference for grade calculation. If there is a discrepancy between the report and the rules page, consider the report to be buggy.
